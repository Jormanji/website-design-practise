    <h2> What do I need to become a Northcoder? </h2>

    <p> When you try to become a Northcoder, you really need to make sure you have the following things:</p>

    <ul>
    <li><b>A computer that is capable of running Linux or a Macbook.</b></li>
    <p>This is needed as Windows is less functional for coding that Linux or Mac. </p>
     
    <li><b> Ability to complete the intro challenge! </b></li>
    <p> Don't worry, this is a relaxed environment that is just here to test your understanding of what you have learned in the self-directed learning.</p>

    <li><b>Determination and a love of problem solving</b></li>
    <p> When coding, most of your life will be spent solving problems with your code!</p>
    </ul>

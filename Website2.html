    <h1> Why do I need a Mac or Linux?</h1>
    <p> The reason why we use a Mac or Linux for our coding course is because of the
        freedom that these OSs (Operating Systems) provide when doing our coding. If
        you are unable to uninstall Windows or purchase a new laptop/computer that can 
        run linux or Mac, you are still able to install a program called Ubuntu which
        will run a virtual operating system for you.
